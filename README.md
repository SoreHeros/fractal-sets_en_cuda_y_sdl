idk if this will even run on other computers, but if you do, theese are the controls:

f: forces screen reset (very necesary)

mouse 1: drag to move arround the screen

mouse 2: places a point so you can see the path that it follows

mouse 3: changes Z0 or C depending on the selected mode

mouse wheel / + / -: zoom

s: switches visualization modes (usually, Z0 is constant and C changes per pixel, when you switch, C is constant and Z0 changes per pixel)

p: reset point path

r: resets camera position, zoom and Z0 (or C)

if you are feeling aventurous enought, you can change the function function(Z, C) to your liking, currently it does Z^2 + C, but you can use theese functions too!:

mult_c, sum_c, log_c, pow_c (may be glithcy if exponent is not an integer)
